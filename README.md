# regular-to-admin

This is a fun and educational C++ project that I created to help me learn Windows API and user management in C++. It turns your normal Windows account into an admin account. For educational purposes only.

It's called 'MinecraftInstaller' because of an inside joke between me and a friend, but it's not a scam or some ass virus. so please don't report me. thx
