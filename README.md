# Minecraft Installer (regular-to-admin)

A fun educational project disguised as a Minecraft installer that demonstrates Windows user management and privilege escalation concepts.

## What is this?

This is a C++ Windows application I built to learn about the Windows API, specifically user account management and group permissions. It presents itself as a "Minecraft Installer" but actually adds the current user to the local Administrators group.

## Educational Purpose

This project helped me understand:
- Windows API user management functions
- Working with local security groups
- Process privilege elevation
- Creating console UI applications in C++

## How it works

1. Checks if running with administrator privileges
2. Gets the current username
3. Verifies if user is already in Administrators group
4. Prompts for confirmation (disguised as "install Minecraft")
5. Adds user to local Administrators group
6. Verifies the changes

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Must be run as administrator (right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator)
- Visual Studio 2019+ or compatible C++ compiler with Windows SDK
